# VBASnippets
A Collection of VBA Snippets I wrote and found helpful in Excel.  
I'll try to keep things organized as much as possible.


# How to use?
Just select the script you'd like to use and copy it into Excel's VBA editor.

## List of Scripts:
(name of script) - (what it does)  
__emptySpaceCurrentSelection.bas__ - In a selection range determine if there are any empty cells.  
__basicRangeLoop.bas__ - A basic range loop that populates the current selection. Great for reuse, and can easily be customized for other range loop ideas.
