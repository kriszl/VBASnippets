# VBASnippets
A Collection of VBA Snippets I wrote and found helpful in Excel.  
I'll try to keep things organized as much as possible.


# How to use?
1. Select the script you'd like to use.
2. Enable developer tab inside of Excel.
3. Open the VBA Editor | on Mac it's labeled as Visual Basic (first icon in Developer ribbon tab) same as on Windows.
4. Create a new module using insert and select Module. On Mac you can do this in the Project - VBAProject pane where you have Excel objects, left side of your screen.
5. Paste the copied snippet right inside of the Module1 (Code) window.

## List of Scripts:
(name of script) - (what it does)  
__emptySpaceCurrentSelection.bas__ - In a selection range determine if there are any empty cells.  
__basicRangeLoop.bas__ - A basic range loop that populates the current selection. Great for reuse, and can easily be customized for other range loop ideas.
